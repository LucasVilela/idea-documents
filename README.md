> And you have particular topics that you are recording and updating a summary in your own worlds of your best words, of your best understanding of that topic.
>
> Now, these can be just general , sort of timeless topics.
>
> Like, I'm interested in stoic philosophy, and I have this document I build out and add to about what Stoic philosophy is, who the thinkers are, what their thoughts, major thoughts are, your current summary of how you're thinking about Stoicism being in your own life.
>
> You were through writing consolidating information, structuring information.
>
> Now, again, this is something that real intellectuals get good at doing naturally, but you have to practice it.
>
> So writing and updating these summaries is a good way of doing it.
>
> You can do this same thing with current event topics as well .
>
> There's something going on in the world that you care about.
>
> This scares me or interests me, or it just, it feels important to me.
>
> Create and begin maintaining a document of how you feel about this and why
>
> This is a fantastic way to free yourself from the emotional ping pong game of just, let me expose myself to social media algorithmic content, let me choose a tribe and make that tribe make me feel good or scared and help me get mad about the other tribe.
>
> It gets you out of that trap and allows you to begin building your own understanding of things .
>
> You're worried about AI start building out this document.
>
> Here's what's going on.
>
> Here's the main types of AI, here's where things are.
>
> Here's a list of thinkers and like where they stand.
>
> And this thinker's against this thinker, you organise your thoughts. Really worried or upset or conflicted or uneasy about conflict in the Middle East, build out a document.
